# Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is a tool for managing adn controlling Docker containers. It helps us to mantain our containers online by themselve. We can dsitribute the traffic comming from the world wide web in different instances using the same image.

## Configuration.

We used minikube for creating our local dashboard and kubectl to interact with our cluster. Besides, we created docker images in the Ducker Hub and pulled them from the Docker registry to create our pods, deployments and services.
